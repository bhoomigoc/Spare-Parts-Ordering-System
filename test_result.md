# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "IMAGE DISPLAY ISSUE INVESTIGATION COMPLETE: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Root cause of image display problem found through comprehensive testing. ✅ BACKEND ENDPOINTS WORKING: Image upload (POST /api/admin/upload-image) and serving (GET /api/uploads/{filename}) endpoints function correctly. ✅ NEW UPLOADS WORK: Newly uploaded images return correct /api/uploads/ URLs and can be served successfully. ❌ HISTORICAL IMAGES MISSING: All machine images (3/4 machines) return 404 errors - files lost due to ephemeral storage (/tmp/uploads cleared on restart). ❌ URL FORMAT INCONSISTENCY: Part images stored with incorrect /uploads/ prefix (missing /api), causing display failures. ❌ EPHEMERAL STORAGE PROBLEM: Upload directory /tmp/uploads is temporary and loses files on container restart. IMPACT: Images not displaying on admin and catalog sections due to missing files and wrong URL formats. IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED: 1) Fix URL format inconsistency in database, 2) Re-upload missing images, 3) Implement persistent storage solution."

    message: "PERSISTENT STORAGE MIGRATION VERIFICATION COMPLETE: ✅ ALL 6 STORAGE MIGRATION TESTS PASSED! ✅ MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL: Upload directory successfully changed from /tmp/uploads to /app/backend/uploads (persistent storage). ✅ NEW UPLOADS WORKING: New image uploads save to persistent directory and are immediately accessible via serving endpoint. ✅ IMAGE SERVING FUNCTIONAL: Successfully served 4/4 test files from persistent directory with correct content types (webp, jpg, jpeg). ✅ URL FORMAT CORRECT: New uploads return proper /api/uploads/ URLs. ✅ PERSISTENT STORAGE CONFIRMED: Test upload created file 3db8ae70-c3de-4012-b764-ef2fabda22e6.png in /app/backend/uploads/ and verified file exists. ❌ DATABASE MISMATCH IDENTIFIED: 3/4 machines have image URLs pointing to non-existent files in persistent directory. ✅ HISTORICAL FILES AVAILABLE: Found 11 files in persistent directory, 1 part image matches database. RECOMMENDATION: Update database image references to match existing files in /app/backend/uploads/ or re-upload missing machine images via admin interface."
