The trajectory details the iterative development and significant refactoring of the Bhoomi Enterprises spare parts ordering application. The initial AI engineer built a full-stack MVP with a FastAPI backend and a monolithic React frontend. Development progressed through multiple, detailed user feedback loops.

The first major phase involved implementing core customer-facing features like a dedicated cart page, quantity selectors, and branding. However, the admin panel's CRUD functionality remained broken.

A pivotal feedback round mandated a structural overhaul: eliminating the Subcategory level entirely. This required substantial changes to the backend models in  (making parts belong to multiple machines) and a near-complete rewrite of the admin  and customer-facing  components within the monolithic .

Subsequent feedback focused on fixing bugs introduced by this refactor and adding new features. This included implementing comprehensive checkout form validation, enhancing the order PDF with bank details, fixing the Rupee symbol, and improving the admin orders tab with filtering.

The final and most challenging phase involved debugging a critical issue where machines failed to load on the homepage, particularly in the production preview environment. The root cause was a misconfigured backend URL, which was eventually resolved by correcting the  file and API call structure to use a relative path (), finally rendering the application fully functional. The work concluded after successfully deploying and generating deployment documentation.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build the Bhoomi Enterprises Spare Parts Ordering System, a web application for customers to order parts without an account, managed via a secure admin panel.

**Customer-Facing Application:**
- **Catalog:** Customers browse parts organized directly by Machine Type. A part can belong to multiple machines.
- **Ordering:** Users add items to a persistent cart. The cart page must allow for specifications to be added per item.
- **Checkout:** The checkout form requires mandatory, validated fields: Company Name, Indian Mobile Number, Indian GST Number (15 alphanumeric characters), Delivery Address (min 10 chars), and a valid Email.
- **PDF Generation:** On order submission, a PDF is generated. It must use Rs. for currency, include the firm's bank details, and be shareable via WhatsApp on mobile.

**Admin Panel ():**
- **Authentication:** Secure login for administrators.
- **Catalog Management:** Full CRUD for Machines and Parts, including image uploads for both. Subcategories are completely removed. An inline quick edit for price is required. The catalog must be filterable by machine.
- **Order Management:** Admins can view all orders, with options to filter by customer and sort by date or value. They can also download a PDF of any order.
- **Email Notification:** An email with the order PDF should be sent to a specified company email upon new order submission.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Stack:** FastAPI (Python) backend, React (JavaScript) frontend, MongoDB database.
- **Frontend:**
  - A monolithic Single-Page Application architecture within .
  - UI built with Tailwind CSS.
  - Client-side PDF generation using  and .
  - State management via React hooks (, ).
- **Backend:**
  - RESTful API with all routes prefixed by .
  - Asynchronous database operations using .
  - Pydantic models for data validation.
  - Image uploads handled via  and served from a local directory.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a decoupled frontend/backend architecture, but the implementation within each is monolithic.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the entire backend application. It defines all API endpoints, handles database logic with Motor, manages admin authentication (JWT), processes image uploads, and sends email notifications.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The file was extensively modified. The data models (, ) were updated to remove subcategories and allow a part to be associated with a list of machine IDs. New endpoints were added for inline price editing and fetching parts by machine. Image serving logic was corrected to include the  prefix. Error handling for email sending was added to prevent order failures. The environment variable loading was made more robust to handle deployment environments like Render.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This monolithic file contains the entire React application, including routing, state management, and all components for both the customer and admin sections.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file underwent a near-total rewrite in several stages. The  (admin) and  components were rebuilt to work without subcategories. The  and  were updated with new validation logic and a modified structure. All  API calls were repeatedly modified to fix a recurring issue with the backend URL, finally settling on using a relative path () for the production environment.

-   **Deployment Files**
    -   **Importance:** Files like  (backend) and  (frontend) were created to facilitate deployment on modern cloud platforms as requested by the user.  was also generated.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Admin - Bulk Edit:** A Bulk Edit feature to update multiple parts simultaneously (e.g., prices) was requested but not implemented.
- **Email Notifications:** The backend code for sending emails exists but was made non-blocking to prevent order failures. It requires valid SMTP credentials in the environment variables to be fully functional.
- **User Verification:** Confirm with the user that the Bulk Add feature works as expected after the major refactor.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work was a critical debugging session to fix the primary issue of machine types not loading on the customer-facing homepage within the Emergent preview environment. The user reported seeing a Loading machines... message, indicating an API failure.

The AI engineer correctly diagnosed the problem as an incorrect API URL configuration. The root cause was traced to how the frontend was constructing the request URL from environment variables. The issue went through several incorrect fix attempts:

1.  A double  prefix in the URL.
2.  Using  which doesn't work in the public preview.
3.  Hardcoding the full preview URL, which also failed.

The final, successful fix involved two key changes:
1.  ****: The  was cleared to an empty string for the preview environment.
2.  ****: The  constant was set to use a relative path () when  is not present.

This ensures that in the preview environment, the frontend correctly sends API requests to , which the environment's ingress routes to the backend service. After restarting all services, a screenshot confirmed that the machines were finally loading correctly on the homepage. The work concluded with this successful fix.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the machines are now visible in their Emergent preview environment to ensure the last fix was successful from their perspective.
