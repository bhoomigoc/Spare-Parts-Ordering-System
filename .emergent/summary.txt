The provided trajectory details a comprehensive debugging and deployment effort for the Bhoomi Enterprises application, originally built by a prior AI engineer. The focus shifted from feature development to resolving critical deployment failures and ensuring application stability across Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) platforms, while also addressing user-reported UI discrepancies and login issues.

Key challenges revolved around Python 3.13 incompatibility with various packages (Pillow, Pydantic), leading to repeated build failures on Render. This necessitated numerous updates to , , and  for version compatibility and correct import statements. Frontend deployment on Vercel faced issues with conflicting  properties, incorrect package manager usage (npm <command>

Finally, the admin login functionality was thoroughly tested and confirmed working after backend fixes. The AI engineer diligently updated environment variables and provided detailed deployment guidance, successfully resolving multiple complex infrastructure and code-level problems.

<product_requirements>
The Bhoomi Enterprises Spare Parts Ordering System is a web application enabling customers to order parts without an account, managed via a secure admin panel.

**Customer-Facing Application:**
-   **Catalog:** Browse parts organized directly by Machine Type (parts can belong to multiple machines).
-   **Ordering:** Add items to a persistent cart, with per-item specification entry.
-   **Checkout:** Mandatory, validated fields for Company Name, Indian Mobile Number, Indian GST Number (15 alphanumeric), Delivery Address (min 10 chars), and valid Email.
-   **PDF Generation:** Generates a PDF on order submission, using Rs. for currency, including firm's bank details, and sharable via WhatsApp.

**Admin Panel ():**
-   **Authentication:** Secure login for administrators.
-   **Catalog Management:** Full CRUD for Machines and Parts, including image uploads. Subcategories are completely removed. Requires inline quick edit for price and filtering by machine.
-   **Order Management:** View all orders, filter by customer, sort by date/value, and download order PDFs.
-   **Email Notification:** Email with order PDF sent to a company email on new order submission.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Stack:** FastAPI (Python) backend, React (JavaScript) frontend, MongoDB database.
-   **Frontend:** Monolithic React application in , Tailwind CSS,  &  for PDF, React hooks for state.
-   **Backend:** RESTful API with  prefix,  for async MongoDB, Pydantic for data validation,  for image uploads.
-   **Deployment:** Render for backend, Vercel for frontend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a decoupled frontend/backend architecture, but the implementation within each is monolithic.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the entire FastAPI backend, including API endpoints, database interaction (Motor), admin auth (JWT), image uploads, and email notifications.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Modified to remove hardcoded MongoDB fallback. The JWT import statement was fixed from  to  to align with  usage. An unused  was removed.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Monolithic React file handling routing, state, and all customer/admin components.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The text Review your items was removed from the cart page header. The  constant configuration was re-verified and debugged for environment variable propagation.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Extensively updated for Python 3.13 compatibility: Pillow was updated from  to , Pydantic was updated from  to , and FastAPI was updated from  to . The list was also simplified and version ranges were made exact where appropriate.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the Render deployment configuration for the backend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Updated to specify Python 3.11.7, ensure JWT_SECRET is properly handled (fixing a corrupted  section), and include improved build commands (e.g., Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://d33sy5i8bnduwe.cloudfront.net/simple/
Requirement already satisfied: pip in /root/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages (25.2)).  was confirmed to be .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Specifies the Python runtime version for deployment.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Initially updated to  but later removed as Render defaulted to Python 3.13.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Configures Vercel deployment for the frontend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Resolved the conflict between  and  properties by updating to a modern Vercel configuration using , ,  (set to yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
-   **Admin - Bulk Edit:** A Bulk Edit feature to update multiple parts simultaneously (e.g., prices) was requested but not implemented.
-   **Email Notifications:** The backend code for sending emails exists but was made non-blocking. It requires valid SMTP credentials in the environment variables (, , , ) to be fully functional.
-   **User Verification:** Confirm that the Bulk Add feature works as expected after the major refactor (though Bulk Edit was the specific pending feature mentioned by the user).

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on resolving critical deployment issues for both backend (Render) and frontend (Vercel) and verifying user-reported bugs.
For the **Render backend**,  (Pillow incompatibility with Python 3.13) and  in  (Pydantic incompatibility with Python 3.13) were resolved by updating  to use compatible versions of Pillow (), Pydantic (), and FastAPI (). The  was adjusted, and unused  was removed. A  was fixed by changing  to  in , and an unused  import was removed. The backend API was verified locally to be fully functional.

For the **Vercel frontend**, a deployment error related to  and  properties in  was fixed by updating to a modern Vercel configuration. A dependency conflict ( vs ) was resolved by downgrading  and configuring Vercel to use yarn install v1.22.22

The user reported issues with Vercel not displaying machines and the cart text not being fixed, which were attributed to Vercel's caching/stale deployment. The AI engineer provided troubleshooting steps for Vercel to deploy the latest code.
Finally, the user reported Unable to login in admin panel using demo credentials. The AI engineer successfully verified the admin login functionality on the Vercel-deployed frontend using / credentials, confirming the backend authentication and frontend dashboard display were working.
